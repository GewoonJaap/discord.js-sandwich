  "Remember our Golden Rule: A thin paint sticks to a thick paint.",
  "And that makes it look like birch trees, isn't that sneaky? Heh. Ha. It's gorgeous.",
  "You know me, I gotta put in a big tree.",
  "Here's your bravery test!",
  "Gotta give him a friend. Like I always say 'everyone needs a friend'.",
  "We don't know where it goes. We don't really care.",
  "Any time ya learn, ya gain.",
  "Any way you want it to be, that's just right.",
  "As my son Steve says, just 'smoosh' it in there. It's not a real word, but people seem to know what it means.",
  "Be sure to use odorless paint-thinner. If it's not odorless, you'll find yourself working alone very, very quick.",
  "Let's just blend this little rascal here, ha! Happy as we can be.",
  "Clouds are very, very free.",
  "Just put a few do-ers in there...",
  "Decide where your little footy hills live.",
  "Haha, and just beat the devil out of it.",
  "I like to beat the brush.",
  "You can use a brush rack to hit the brush on. Otherwise you will become unpopular real fast.",
  "If you did this with yellow, and you went over it with blue, you would end up with a .. with a translucent... green. And it's gorgeous. It is GORGEOUS.",

  "Little squirrels 'n' rabbits, and if this was in Florida or Georgia somewhere down there, might be an alligator or two hid back here.",
  "Maybe in our world there lives a happy little tree over there.",
  "Oh, green water... oh that's pretty. Boy, I like that, just alive with algae.",
  "Oh, that would make a nice place to fish. I like fishing, but I'm not a very good fisherman. I always throw the fish back into the water, just put a band-aid on his mouth, tap 'im on the patootie and let him on his way. And maybe some day, if I'm lucky, I'll get to catch him again.",
  "Oooh, if you have never been to Alaska, go there while it is still wild. My favorite uncle asked me if I wanted to go there, Uncle Sam. He said if you don't go, you're going to jail. That is how Uncle Sam asks you.",
  "People look at me like I'm a little strange, when I go around talking to squirrels and rabbits and stuff. That's ok. Thaaaat's just ok.",
  "People might look at you a bit funny, but it's okay. Artists are allowed to be a bit different.",
  "Shwooop. Hehe. You have to make those little noises, or it just doesn't work.",

  "There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.",
  "Trees cover up a multitude of sins.",
  "Try to imagine that you are a tree. How do you want to look out here?",
  "Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things.",
  "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents.",
  "We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.",
  "We want happy paintings. Happy paintings. If you want sad things, watch the news.",
  "We're gonna make some big decisions in our little world.",
  "Well, the little clock on the wall says we're just about out of time. God bless you my friend.",
  "From all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting...and God bless my friend.",

  "Even if you've never painted before, this one you can do.",
  "This is the hardest part of this method. If you can do this, you can do anything.",
  "Roll it in a little bright red and lets sign this right in here. Luckily I have a short name so it's easy to sign.",
  "And just go straight in like your going to stab it. And barely touch it...barely touch it.",

  "Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.",
  "There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.",
  "Let's get crazy.",
  "I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.",
  "I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.",
  "All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.",
  "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.",

  "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents.",
  "In life you need colors.",
  "It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?",
  "Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall",
  "It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet",
  "Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.",
  "Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.",
  "They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers - just to upset the critics.",

  "We must be quiet, soft and gentle.",
  "You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.",
  "Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.",
  "I remember when my Dad told me as a kid, ‘If you want to catch a rabbit, stand behind a tree and make a noise like a carrot. Then when the rabbit comes by you grab him.' Works pretty good until you try to figure out what kind of noise a carrot makes…",
  "Just make a decision and let it go.",
  "Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.",
  "You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.",
  "We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.",
  "We don't know where it's going - and we don't need to care. Just let it go.",
  "And when you practice this you will see that you are able to use anything that happens.",
  "See these things in your mind - then make them real.",
  "A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.",
  "You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.",
  "This your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.",
  "We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.",
  "It is your world - but even in your world you just have to let it happen.",
  "We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.",
  "Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.",
  "I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.",
  "We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.",
  "Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do."
